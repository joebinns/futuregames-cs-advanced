# Game programming with C# -- Advanced
Please criticise my work! I am trying to improve as a game programmer, at the moment I am especially interested in improving my adherence to the SOLID principles.

## Lecture 1: Setup

## Lecture 2: Class Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance and Composition

## Lecture 3: Cube Art
I'm trying to keep the SOLID principles in mind when doing things now, although this case felt too simple to warrant any rework.
